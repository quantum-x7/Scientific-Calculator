This Python script is a terminal-based calculator featuring both basic arithmetic and scientific functions. It uses the math and datetime modules to perform calculations and log history with timestamps. Users can execute operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and scientific functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, square root, inverse trigonometric functions, squaring, and cubing. The calculator maintains a history in a text file, allowing users to view or clear past calculations. Input is command-based, with error handling for invalid formats, values, and edge cases like division by zero or invalid square roots. The interface is interactive, guiding users through available commands and functions for a seamless experience.
